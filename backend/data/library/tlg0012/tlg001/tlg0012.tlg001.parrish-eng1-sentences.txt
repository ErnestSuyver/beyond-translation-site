2274106 Sing, goddess, the godlike wrath of Achilles, son of Peleus, that sociopathic wrath
2274106a that caused countless pains for the Achaeans.
2274106b It hurled to Hades many precious lives of warriors.
2274106c And it began to make their bodies into picked-over scraps for dogs and for birds, all of them;
2274106d and the plan of Zeus began to be fulfilled,
2274106e from the point where  first, the two having both begun a competition with each other, both of them faced off, the son of Atreus, lord of men, and god-like Achilles.
2274107 Who  then of the gods threw together the two of them to fight in competition with one another?
2274108 The son of Leto and of Zeus:
2274109 for that one, filled with anger at the king, set in motion an evil sickness up through the camp.
2274109a And the soldiers began to be killed, because he showed disrespect to that man Chryses, the god-talker. What man? -- the son of Atreus.
2274110 Here is what happened: a man, came to the swift ships of the Achaeans in order to free  his daughter and bearing boundless ransom, holding the wreaths of the far-shooter Apollo in his hands high up on his golden staff.
2274110a And he began to plead with all the Achaeans, and especially with the two sons of Atreus, the organizers of the soldiers:
2274111 “Sons of Atreus and also all the well-greaved Achaeans, with my blessing may the gods, having homes on Olympus, confer gift on you to sack utterly the city of Priam, and to return homewards well;
2274112 but for me free my beloved child, and accept this ransom, showing reverence for the son of Zeus, the far-shooter Apollo.
2274113 At that point indeed all the Achaeans shouted their approval, both to treat with decency the sacrifice-leader and to accept the shining ransom;
2274114 However, this was not sweet to Atreus’ son, Agamemnon, in his heart,
2274114a Instead, he dismissed him cruelly.
2274114b  He began to impose a harsh command:
2274115 “May( emphasizing with tone and body language the pronoun “I”) I not come upon you, old man, near the hollow ships, either hanging around now or returning back later, lest even at that time the staff and wreaths of the god may not protect you.
2274116 that woman ( again, emphasizing with tone and body language the pronoun “I”) I will not free,
2274117 until( Agamemnon emphasizes the next two words as a taunt) old age comes upon her in our house in Argos, far from her fatherland, working the loom and serving my bed.
2274118 Instead go away!
2274118a Do not keep provoking me me thus so that you might make your way home more safely than if you remain.
2274119 So he spoke.
2274119a The old man became frightened.
2274119b And he began to obey the command.
2274120 He walked  in silence to the shore of the loudly-roaring sea.
2274121 And then, going far away, that old man as god-talker began speaking to lord Apollo, he whom light-haired Leto bore:
2274122 “Hear me, silver-bowed one, you who stands guard over Chrysa and sacred Cilla, and are lord of Tenedos by force,
2274122a Smintheus, if at any time I roofed over a shrine pleasing to you, or if  at any time I completely burned fat thigh-bones for you, of bulls and of goats, fulfill this  wish for me:
2274123 may the Danaans pay their respects to my tears with your arrows.
2274124 So he spoke praying.
2274124a Phoebus Apollo listened to that man .
2274124b Seething with anger in his heart, he came  down from the top of Olympus, carrying his bow and his covered quiver on his shoulders.
2274125 The arrows rattled noisily  on the shoulders of the god as he seethed with anger, once he himself began to move.
2274126 That one  made his way like night.
2274127 Then he began to crouch far away from the ships.
2274127a He fired an arrow in their midst-
2274128 Fearsome was the rattle from the silver bow.
2274129 First he began to go after the mules and the swift dogs,
2274129a but then, letting fly a sharp arrow against the men themselves, he began to strike.
2274130 The pyres of the corpses, one after another, were kept burning without any break.
2274131 For nine days, to start with, the arrows of the god kept moving up through the camp,
2274131a On the tenth day, however, Achilles summoned the soldiers to an assembly,
2274132 The white-armed goddess Hera, as it happened, placed this within that man’s mind.
2274133 This was the reason: she kept worrying about the Danaans, because  she kept watching them as they died.
2274134 After those  were assembled and so were gathered together, swift-footed Achilles, standing up, spoke among them :
2274135 “Son of Atreus, now I believe that we, driven back, will return to our homes again- if death, we might flee at all. If truly war and plague together will force the Achaeans into submission.
2274136 Instead, come,  let us ask either some seer or sacrifice-leader, or even a dream-interpreter, for  a dream is also from Zeus. That man may say why Phoebus Apollo became so greatly filled with anger; whether  he reproaches us on account of a vow or a sacrifice, or if he in any way, having met with the rich aroma of Amelia Parrish 2020-08-04T17:28:24 'fully-grown' from 'telos' origins; where is 'without a spot or blemish' reflected in the greek? fully-grown sheep and goats, would be willing to avert destruction from us.
2274137  Having spoken thus, that man sat down:
2274138  among them stood up Calchas, son of Thestor, best by far of all the bird-interpreters, who knew the things that are, and the things that will be, and the things that were before, and who had led the ships of the Achaeans into Troy through his own gift of foresight, which Phoebus Apollo gave to him.
2274139 That man, thinking benevolently for them, addressed the assembly, and spoke in their midst:
2274140 “Achilles, beloved of Zeus, you order me to explain the wrath of Apollo, the lord far-shooter:
2274141 therefore( Calchas emphasizes the “I” with his intonation and body language) I will speak.
2274142 And as for you, take this in
2274142a and swear to me most decidedly that to help me with determination, with your words and with your hands.
2274143 For I truly expect to fill with anger a man, he who greatly holds power over all the Argives, and whom the Achaeans obey:
2274144 for the king has more power, whenever he is angry at an inferior man.
2274145 Here’s the reason:  even if, in fact, he would choke down his anger on that one particular day, nevertheless just as certainly going forward he holds a grudge in his chest, until he can fulfill it,
2274146 So, as for you, make yourself clear, if you will protect me.
2274147 Swift-footed Achilles, answering, addressed that man:
2274148 “Having taken heart fully, give voice to the god’s message, whatever it is you know.
2274149 For by Apollo, beloved of Zeus, and for whom you, Calchas, speaking with authority, reveal divine messages to the Danaans, no one, with me living and able to see upon this earth, will bear upon you heavy hands near the hollow ships- not any of all the Danaans together, not even you are speaking about Agamemnon, he who boasts to be by far the best of the Achaeans.
2274150  Then  he took courage
2274150a and he began to speak, the blameless prophet:
2274151 “ Indeed that one finds fault neither with a vow nor a sacrifice, but rather, because of the god-talker, the man to whom Agamemnon showed disrespect:
2274151a he did not  free his daughter, nor did he accept the ransom.
2274151b  Because of this the far-shooter gave sufferings and he will continue to give still.
2274152 That one certainly will not  first drive off shameful destruction for the Danaans, before you give back the bright-eyed girl to her beloved father without a price, without a ransom, and lead a holy sacrifice to Chrysa:
2274153 then we, having appeased him, might cause a change of heart.
2274154 That man, having spoken thus, sat down :
2274155 Then among them stood up the warrior son of Atreus, wide-ruling Agamemnon, stricken with pain.
2274156 His black heart completely begin being filled with rage.
2274156a His two eyes became like blazing fire.
2274157 Glaring evilly first of all at Calchas, he spoke:
2274158 “Seer of evil things, you have never yet once said a favorable thing to me:
2274159 these evil things are always dear to you in your heart to prophesy,
2274159a and as for the fortunate, you never yet spoke any word nor accomplished anything.
2274160 And now, speaking on behalf of the gods, you declare among the Danaans that, that the far-shooter produces sufferings for them because of this particular thing: because I, for my part, was not willing to accept the shining ransom of the girl Chryseis, since I very much wish to hold that particular woman at home.
2274161 And in fact  I have come to prefer her over Clytemnestra, my lawful wife, since she is not inferior to her- not in form, nor in stature, nor  in mind, nor in any respect in the things that she can produce.
2274162 Yet even so I am willing to give her back, if this really is better:
2274163 I, for my part, wish the soldiers to be safe, rather than to be wiped out.
2274164 As for me, prepare a prize appropriate for my rank immediately, so that alone of the Argives I am not without a prize, since this is also not fitting.
2274165 After all, each and every one of you see this, don’t you- that my prize goes elsewhere.
2274166 And then swift-footed godly Achilles proceeded to answer him:
2274167 “Son of Atreus, the man with the most glory, and most attached to possessions of all, how exactly will the Achaeans, great-hearted give you a prize?
2274168 We do not  know of great common stores lying around anywhere at all.
2274169 Rather, as we all know, the things which we sacked from the cities, these things have been handed out.
2274169a and on the other hand it would also not be fitting for the soldiers to gather together again these clawed-back things things.
2274170 Instead, you for your part now release this girl to the god.
2274171 On our part, the Achaeans will repay you three times, and even four times, over, if Zeus at some point may confer the gift to sack completely the well-walled city Troy.
2274172 And answering, the ruler Agamemnon addressed that man:
2274173 “Do not  in this way- although being skillful, godlike Achilles- cheat with your mind, since you will not slip past nor persuade me.
2274174 Do you really want- while you yourself are to hold onto your own prize- me, for my part, like this to sit still without having one?
2274174a Are you telling me to give back this particular woman?
2274175  Mind you, if the great-hearted Achaeans will give me a prize, having fashioned it exactly according to my heart, so that it will be worth just as much … (Agamemnon uses non-verbal communication -- perhaps a shrug of the shoulders -- to communicate that this would be acceptable)
2274176 But, if they should not make a gift, then I myself, going in person would take possession for myself either your prize or that of Ajax, or that of Odysseus. Having taken position, I will lead it away.
2274177 That man  will be angry and stay angry, whomever I would approach.
2274178 That said,  certainly we will return to consider once again these things,
2274178a Now, come. Let us drag a black ship into the divine sea.
2274178b Let us gather within sufficient rowers.
2274178c A sacrifice let us place inside.
2274178d The beautiful-cheeked Chryseis herself we will embark.
2274179 And let some single counsel-bearing man be the leader, either Ajax or Idomeneus or godlike Odysseus, or you, Son of Peleus, most outrageous of all men, unti, having performed sacrifices, you will appease him, the free-worker.
2274180 Having given dark look  swift-footed Achilles addressed that man,
2274181 “How dare you! You, all clothed in indecency, obsessed by profit, how would any of the Achaeans with determination listen to your words, either to go on a journey or with his own strength to fight with men?
2274182 That is to be expected: I certainly did not come on account of Trojan spearmen here in order to fight, since they are not at fault to me in any way:
2274183 for they did not ever drive away my cattle, nor  my horses, nor in warrior-nourishing, fertile Phthia did they ever harm the harvest, since there are many things between: many  shady mountains and also the roaring sea.
2274184 Instead you, oh unbelievably indecent one, together we followed so that you might rejoice, seeking to gain respect for Menelaus and for you, dog-face, from the Trojans.
2274185 Of these things you do not consider at all.
2274185a Nor do you give a damn-
2274186 And now you make make threats that you yourself to seize for yourself my prize, for which I struggled at length, and which the sons of the Achaeans gave to me.
2274187 Certainly I never have a prize equal to yours, whenever the Achaeans sack and pillage a well-managed city of the Trojans.
2274188 Instead, you may be sure, the greater part of the miserable fighting my hands perform;
2274189 nevertheless whenever the division of spoils is at hand, for you the prize is much greater,
2274189a while a smaller yet precious prize I for my part go on my way carrying upon the ships, after I am exhausted from waging war.
2274190 But now I will go to Phthia, since it is surely much superior to go home with the curved ships.
2274190a With me being disrespected here, I do not plan, to ladle out riches and wealth for you.
2274191 And then the lord of men, Agamemnon, began to answer him:
2274192 “By all means run away, if your heart is stirred in that direction.
2274192a  I, for one, certainly, do not plead with you to stay on account of me:
2274193 beside me, you can be sure, are others as well who will respect me- - and most of all, Zeus, the giver of counsel.
2274194 You are the most hateful  to me of the kings fostered by Zeus:
2274195 for competing with others is always dear to you, as are both wars and battles.
2274196 If you are very strong, at some point a god gave this  to you.
2274197 Going home with both your own ships and with your own comrades, lord it over the Myrmidons.
2274197a  And as for me, I don’t give a damn about you,
2274197b nor do I worry about you bearing a grudge.
2274198 But I will make the following threat to you:
2274199 as Phoebus Apollo is taking away for himself from me Chryseis, that woman, you can be sure, I will send on her way with both my own ship and my own comrades.
2274199a For my part, however, I will lead beautiful-cheeked Briseis, that  prize of yours, going myself to your resting-place, so that you will clearly see how greatly I am superior to you, and another man as well will fear to declare himself an equal to me, and to treat himself as a peer to my face.
2274200 So he spoke.
2274201 And pain materialized in the son of Peleus.
2274201a The heart in his hairy chest was torn in two directions: whether HE having drawn for himself the sharp sword from beside his thigh, would  make the men stand back while he for his part would kill the son of Atreus, or he could stop his anger and restrain his heart.
2274202 As he was turning over these things through his thoughts and through his heart, he was beginning to pull for himself  from his sheath a great sword, but Athena came from heaven.
2274203 The reason for this was that the white-armed goddess Hera sent her forth, both caring about and concerned for the two men equally in her heart.
2274204 She stood  behind him,
2274204a and by his light hair she gripped the son of Peleus, making herself visible to him alone.
2274205 None of the others  could see.
2274206 Achilles was astonished ,
2274206a and turned himself around.
2274206b And right then and there he recognized Pallas Athena.
2274207 and her two eyes appeared terrifying.
2274208  Having addressed her, he began to give voice to winged words:
2274209 “There you are! Why, daughter of aegis-holding Zeus, have you come?
2274210 Is it  so that you might see for yourself the outrageous behavior of Agamemnon, son of Atreus?
2274211 Whatever the answer I will tell you something.
2274211a And this as well I expect to be fulfilled:
2274212 by his outrageous actions soon he will destroy his life.
2274213 Then to him the goddess spoke, owl-eyed Athena:
2274214 “I, for part, came in order to stop this rage of yours- - if you might obey- - down from the heavens.
2274215 The white-armed goddess Hera sent me forth, both caring about and concerned for both equally in her heart.
2274216 Instead, come on. Step away from this quarrel.
2274216a Do not keep drawing for yourself the sword in your hand.
2274217 Instead, by all means, with words as much as you please paint him a nasty picture of how he can be sure it will be:
2274218 Because I will tell you how this is is.
2274218a And as well this will in reality be fulfilled.
2274219 In the future, there will be present in your possession three times as many shining gifts because of the outrageous behavior that we see here.
2274220 As for you, hold yourself back.
2274220a Listen to to us.
2274221 And, replying, swift-footed Achilles said to her:
2274222 “Of course, goddess, it is necessary to heed a statement from the two of you, at last , even though really filled up with anger in one’s heart.
2274223 For it is better this way.
2274224 Whoever obeys the gods, they really  listen to that man.
2274225 He spoke.
2274225a And on the silver hilt he held his heavy hand,
2274225b Back into the sheath he shoved the great sword,
2274225c and he did not disobey the command of Athena.
2274226 But as for that goddess, she had already departed to Olympus, into the home of aegis-holding Zeus among the other divinities.
2274227 The son of Peleus  yet again with harsh words spoke to the son of Atreus.
2274227a And he was not yet stepping away from his anger;
2274228 “Swollen with wine, having the eyes of a dog but the heart of a deer, never to arm yourself for battle together with the army, nor ever to enter an ambush  with the most outstanding of the Achaeans have you had the fortitude in your heart.
2274229 That seems to you to be death.
2274230 Surely it is much more preferable along the broad camp of the Achaeans to take away for yourself gifts from whoever may have speak against you.
2274231 You are a king who devours his people, because you lord over nobodies!
2274232 For truly, son of Atreus, you would now have acted abusively for the last time.
2274233 Instead I will explain to you,
2274233a and besides I will swear a great oath.
2274234 Truly by this very staff, which never in truth will sprout leaves and branches, after  it first left behind its stump in the mountains, nor will it flourish again.
2274235 For the bronze stripped it all around both the leaves and the bark.
2274236 Now, however, the sons of the Achaeans, acting as judges, carry it in their palms, they who  defend the laws of the cosmos on behalf of Zeus.
2274237 This  will be a great oath to you.
2274238 In the future certainly a desire for Achilles will come upon the sons of the Achaeans each and every one of them!
2274239 And then you, though stricken with pain, will not have the power to provide protection in the least, when many fall dying at the hands of Hector the man-slaughterer.
2274240 You  will gouge open your own heart within, consumed with fury because you showed respect to in no way the best of the Achaeans.
2274241 So spoke the son of Peleus.
2274241a And he flung against the ground the staff, drilled with golden studs.
2274241b And he himself began to sit.
2274242 And the son of Atreus from the other side continued in wrath.
2274243 And among them Nestor, pleasing in speech lept up, the articulate assembly-speaker of the Pylians, and from that man’s tongue speech began to flow, sweeter than honey.
2274244 Already for him already two generations of mortal men had passed away, who previously along with him were raised and born in most holy Pylos.
2274244a And now, he was lord among the third generation.
2274245 He, thinking constructively for them, addressed the assembly and spoke in their midst:
2274246 “I can’t believe it! For sure great sorrow has reached the Achaean land;
2274247 You can be sure Priam would rejoice, as would the children of Priam, while the other Trojans would filled with pleasure greatly in their hearts, if they should hear about all these things here, about the two of you fighting, you who are above  the Danaans in planning, and above in fighting.
2274248 Stop it! Listen to me!
2274249 the two of you both  are younger than I am:
2274250 For as for me, already at times, with men even better than you both, spent my time.
2274250a And not once would those men, you may be sure dismiss me.
227425 Let me tell you, never have I seen, nor would I see with my own eyes, such men, such as Peirithous and Dryas, the shepherd of the soldiers, and Caeneus and Exadius and also godlike Polyphemus, and the son of Aegeus’ son, Theseus, a man like the immortals.
2274252 those were brought up as the mightiest of the men on earth.
2274253 Let me make this point clear: they were the mightiest.
2274253a And they would fight against the mightiest- - against mountain-dwelling centaurs.
2274253b And utterly they annihilated them.
2274254 First, I used to spend my time among those men, having come from Pylos, from far away, from a distant land.
2274255 Why did I come? Because  called for me.
2274256 And I would fight on my own with my own two hands- I did that!
2274257 And let me make this point clear as well, with those men (gesturing in the distance to emphasize the separation from the present)  no one of those who are now mortals on this earth could put up a fight.
2274258 But you may be sure, they paid attention to my plans
2274258a and they would listen to my recommendations.
2274259 And so now, listen to me- - and I mean you (plural, addressing Agamemnon and Achilles both)! -- because to listen is better.
2274260 As for you (singular, addressing Agamemnon), high-ranking though you are- do not take away for yourself the girl from this man here.
2274260a Instead, leave it just as at first the sons of Achaeans gave the prize to him;
2274261 And as for you, do not, son of Peleus, choose to compete with a king, pitting your strength against his, since a staff-holding king, to whom  Zeus gave renown never has received possession of a position of respect that is comparable.
2274262 If  you are stronger, a goddess  as mother bore you, nevertheless he still is superior since he is lord over more people.
2274263 Son of Atreus, as for you, stop your rage:
2274264 look! I, for my part, I beg you to let go of your anger towards Achilles, he who to all the Achaeans is a great defense in cruel war.
2274265 And, answering him, ruling Agamemnon spoke:
2274266 “Sure enough,  you said all these things  rightly, old man.
2274267 But this man here wishes to be above all others.
2274267a Not only does he desire to be stronger than everyone, but also to be lord over everyone, and to give orders to everyone. As far as these things are concerned, I don’t expect anyone to listen.
2274268 If  the gods, existing always, made him a spearman, for that reason do they allow him to publicly deliver insults?
2274269 But then, interrupting, godlike Achilles began to answer him:
2274270 “Surely  I would be called both a coward and a nobody, if  I will yield to you in each action, whatever you might say.
2274271 To other men, for all I care, make these commands.
2274271a Because, to me, you can be sure, don’t give any orders.
2274272 In fact I, for my part, do not expect to listen to you in the future.
2274273 And I will tell you another thing.
2274273a You for your part,  deposit it into your heart:
2274274 indeed I will not fight against  you with my hands on account of the girl- - not with you, not with any other man- - since you (pl), having given her, now take her away for yourselves from me .
2274275 But as for the other things, which are in my possession beside the swift black ship, of these things you may not carry away anything, having picked it up with me unwilling.
2274276 But come on- really, try for yourself, so that these men here as well may learn-
2274277 your dark blood will pour out right then and there around my spear.
2274278 Thus the two of them , having fought with such opposing speeches, they stood up,
2274278a and they dismissed the assembly beside the ships of the Achaeans.
2274279 The son of Peleus, on the one hand, went on his way towards the resting-places and the well-balanced ships with both the son of Menoetius and his comrades.
2274280 Meanwhile, the son of Atreus  dragged forward a swift ship to the sea.
2274280a And therein he selected twenty rowers.
2274280b And a sacrifice for the god he embarked,
2274280c and up into the ship he, leading, seated the beautiful-cheeked Chryseis.
2274281 And in went as leader the adaptable Odysseus.
2274282 Then they, or on their side, having embarked, began to sail over the watery routes,
2274282a while the son of Atreus commanded the soldiers to purify themselves.
2274283 Those  began purifying themselves.
2274283a And they flinging the impurities into the sea.
2274283b Then they began to perform potent sacrifices for Apollo, of bulls and of goats, along the shore of the barren sea:
2274284 and the aroma reached the heavens, swirling about in the smoke.
2274285 In this way they  began working on these things down throughout the camp.
2274286 But, Agamemnon was not stepping away from the competition which he first threatened against Achilles,
2274286a Instead he  spoke to both Talthybius and Eurybates, those two who were his heralds and ready attendants:
2274287 “You two go to the resting-place of Peleus’ son, Achilles.
2274288 After seizing beautiful-cheeked Briseis by the hand, bring her.
2274289 If  he should not give her, then I myself person would seize her for myself, having come with an more men.
2274290 And for him that will be more to be feared.
2274291 Having spoken thus, he sent them forth.
2274291a He imposed the cruel command.
2274292 the two, unwilling,  both walked along the shore of the barren sea,
2274292a The two of them arrived at both the resting-places and the ships of the Myrmidons.
2274292b That man they found beside both his resting-place and his black ship, sitting.
2274293 Nor did Achilles rejoice at all having caught sight of those two.
2274294 On the one hand, the two men, terrified at, and feeling shame before, the king, stood there.
2274294a but They did not begin to address
2274294b him about anything nor did they ask any questions.
2274295 For his part that man understood the situation in his heart
2274295a and spoke:
2274296 “Welcome, heralds, messengers of Zeus and also of men,
2274296a Come closer.
2274297 Don’t worry, you are not to be responsible to me for anything: instead Agamemnon is, the one who sent you two forth on account of the girl Briseis.(
2274298 Achilles turns to Patroclus) Come, Zeus-born Patroclus, bring out the girl
2274298a and give her to these two to lead away.
2274299 And let these two themselves be witnesses both before the blessed gods and before mortal people, and before that unfeeling king, if some day  again need of me should arise to defend against shameful destruction for those others.
2274300 For surely he is out of control, with a self-destructive heart,
2274300a  He does not at all understand how to plan for the future and the past together so that the Achaeans might in the future fight besides the ships, safe under his watch.
2274301 So he spoke,
2274301a and Patroclus began to obey his beloved companion;
2274301b  he led the beautiful-cheeked Bryseis out of the resting-place,
2274301c and he gave her to lead away.
2274302 The two of them  went back along the ships of the Achaeans,
2274303 and that person, the woman, unwilling, started on her way along with those people.
2274304 As for Achilles, having started to cry, he at once took a seat far away from his companions, sinking down upon the shore of the gray saltwater and gazing out upon the boundless sea.
2274305 And he  at length as god-talker spoke to to his beloved mother, stretching out his hands:
2274306 “Mother, since you did after all give birth to me, although being destined for a short life, a position commanding appropriate respect, at the very least, the Olympian ought to extend to me- Zeus thundering on high.
2274307 But now not even a little did he show respect to me.
2274308 That is clearly the case because, in truth, the son of Atreus, wide-ruling Agamemnon, has shown disrespect to me.
2274309 For, having snatched my prize, he holds it- - he himself having stolen it.
2274310 So he spoke, shedding tears.
2274310a That man his revered mother heard, sitting in the depths of the sea beside her father, an old man.
2274311 Swiftly  she rose up from the gray sea like the mist,
2274311a and  before that man, with him shedding tears, she sat down With her hand she caressed him and she also spoke, and began speaking to him by name: “2274312 Son, why are you crying?
2274313 What  sorrow reached your heart?
2274314 Speak out- - do not conceal it in your mind! -- so that we both might know.
2274315 Groaning deeply, he answered her , the swift-footed Achilles:
2274316 “You know-
2274317 why then should I list all these things to you, who already know?
2274318 We made our way into Thebes, the sacred city of Eetion.
2274318a That city we sacked from one end to the other, and we also led everything here.
2274319 And while these things the sons of the Achaeans divided up well among themselves:
2274319a And they took out the beautiful-cheeked daughter of Chryses for the son of Atreus.
2274320 But then Chryses, the sacrifice-leader of the far-shooter Apollo, came to the swift ships of the bronze-wearing Achaeans in order to free  his daughter, bearing  boundless ransom, holding the wreaths of the far-shooter Apollo in his hands aloft on his golden staff.
2274320a And he began to plead with all the Achaeans, and especially with the two sons of Atreus, the organizers of the soldiers.
2274321 At that point indeed all the other Achaeans responded approvingly, both to treat with decency the sacrifice-leader and to accept the shining ransom.
2274322 However, this was not sweet to the son of Atreus, Agamemnon, in his heart.
2274322a Instead, he dismissed him cruelly.
2274322b  He began to impose upon him a harsh command.
2274323  The old man, seething with anger, made his way back.
2274324 and to him, after he had begun his prayer, Apollo listened, because Chryses was very dear to him.
2274324a And he fired an evil arrow against the Argives.
2274325 Now those soldiers, one after another, kept dying.
2274325a And those arrows of the god kept flying in on every side up through the wide camp of the Achaeans.
2274326 To us  the prophet, thinking benevolently, began to publicly deliver the prophecies of the far-shooter.
2274327 Immediately I was the one who first began to urge that we should appease the god.
2274328 But then anger took hold of the son of Atreus,
2274328a Instantly after standing up he gave a threatening command, which  has been brought to completion.
2274329 Here is what I mean: that woman, to begin with, the quick-eyed Achaeans with a swift ship send to Chryses,
2274329a At the same time, they bring gifts for the lord.
2274330 But this other woman just now the heralds went on their way, leading her away from my resting-place- - the daughter of Briseus, the woman whom the sons of the Achaeans gave to me.
2274331 But if you really have the power, protect your noble son.
2274332 Having gone to Olympus, plead with Zeus, if at any time  in any way either by what you have said or in fact by what you have done you cheered the heart of Zeus.
2274333 For often in the great rooms of your father I have heard you boasting, when you stated that for black-clouded son of Cronos you alone among the immortals fought off shameful destruction, when the other Olympians wished to tie him up, both Hera and Poseidon and even Pallas Athena.
2274334 But you, goddess, having come, released that one from his chains, having immediately called the hundred-handed one into great Olympus, he whom the gods call Briareus, and all men Aegaeon.
2274334a For that one, in turn, is better than his father in terms of physical strength.
2274335 He then sat down beside the son of Cronos, basking in his aura of power.
2274336 And before him they cowered the blessed gods.
2274336a So they did not still tie him up.
2274337 Now, having reminded him of these things, sit at his side and take hold of his knees, if somehow he might be willing to bring aid upon the Trojans, and to squeeze together the Achaeans both down among their ships’ decks, and around the sea, as they are killed, so that all may enjoy the full benefit of their king; and the son of Atreus, widely-ruling Agamemnon, also may recognize his own self-destructive stupidity, in that he showed no respect to the best of the Achaeans.
2274338 And Thetis, pouring down tears, then began to answer him:
2274339 “(sighing deeply) My son, why did I take the time to raise you- I, after bearing you for awful things?
2274340 I wish you might be able, beside the ships, without tears and without suffering, to remain quietly! since, even now, the fate assigned to you is brief as it is, is not very long at all.
2274341 But now, you are, simultaneously, both doomed to die soon and unhappy beyond all people
2274342 So it was for an evil destiny that I gave birth to you in the great rooms.
2274343 To present this  statement for you to Zeus, who delights in thunderbolt, I, in person, will go to snow-covered Olympus in the hopes that he may be persuaded.
2274344 But as for you, now sitting beside the swift-sailing ships, continue in wrath against the Achaeans.
2274344a Put a stop to your actions away from war completely.
2274345 For Zeus yesterday went into Oceanus to the midst of the blameless Ethiopians, on account of a feast
2274345a All the gods began to follow along.
2274346 But on the twelfth day he will come back again to Olympus.
2274346a And at that time, then on your behalf I will go to the bronze-floored house of Zeus,
2274346b and I will clasp him by his knees.
2274346c And I expect to make my case successfully to him.
2274347 Having spoken thus  she went away.
2274347a That one  she left then and there, filled with anger throughout his heart because of the well-girdled woman, she whom  they were stealing by force with him being unwilling.
2274348 As for Odysseus, he was on his way to Chrysa, bringing a sacred sacrifice.
2274349 When they   entered within the very deep harbor first they took in their sails, then they placed them in the black ship.
2274349a Then they guided the mast to the mast-holder having lowered it with ropes quickly.
2274349b With oars they rowed it forward into the anchoring-area.
2274350 And out they cast the anchors.
2274350a They tied down the boat’s stern-cables;
2274351 As for the men themselves they made their way out at the edge of the sea.
2274351a They disembarked the sacrifice for the far-shooter Apollo;
2274352 And out of the sea-faring ship Chryseis walked.
2274353 And then at that point Odysseus, a man of many counsels, leading her up to the altar, put her in her beloved father’s hands.
2274353a And he spoke to him:
2274354 “ Chryses, the lord of men sent me forth, Agamemnon, both to lead your child to you and to perform a sacred sacrifice for Phoebus on behalf of the Danaans, so that we may appease the lord, he who now has set in motion grievous troubles to the Argives.
2274355 Having spoken in this way, he placed her in his hands. 2274355a And that man, rejoicing, received his beloved daughter.
2274356 Quickly the sacred sacrifice for the  god they made stand in a row about the well-built altar.
2274356a Then they purified their hands with water and picked up in their hands ground barley.
2274357 Then among them Chryses, having raised his hands, began to pray loudly:
2274358 “Listen to me, silver-bowed one, you who encircled Chrysa and sacred Cilla, and are lord of Tenedos by force.
2274359 Just as certainly  once before you listened to me when I had prayed,
2274359a and just as certainly you conferred respect upon me, at you also greatly harmed the soldiers of the Achaeans.
2274360 And still even now, for me fulfill in addition the following wish:
2274361 Right this minute, now, drive way shameful destruction from the Danaans.
2274362 So he spoke, praying,
2274362a and Phoebus Apollo listened to him.
2274363 But then after they prayed and cast forth the ground barley, they first pulled back  the heads of the offerings, and then slaughtered and flayed them. They cut away the thighs  and wrapped up and down them in fat, having made it double-folded.
2274363a Then they placed raw meat on top of the thigh pieces themselves.
2274364 The old man began to burn them on skewers.
2274364a Then he began to pour flashing wine on.
2274365 The young men  next to him were holding five-pronged forks in their hands.
2274366 After a while when the thigh pieces were burned thoroughly and they tasted the organs, they began to cut up  the rest and also pierced them with spits through both sides; they skillfully roasted  them, and pulled off for themselves everything.
2274367 After a while, when they stopped themselves from work and prepared for themselves the feast, they kept sharing the feast, nor was their heart lacking in any way from the evenly-divided feast.
2274368 After a while, when they rid themselves of the desire for drink and for food, the young men first for themselves they filled to the brim mixing-bowls with drink, then they distributed  this to everyone, having made the initial libations with the drinking-cups.
2274369 Those men  throughout the entire day continued to appease the god through song and dance, the elite young men of the Achaeans singing the beautiful song to Apollo, celebrating with song the far-shooter.
2274370 And that one, listening, was pleased in his heart.
2274371 And when the sun sank and dusk arrived, then  they lay themselves down to sleep beside the stern-cables of the ship.
2274372 And when early-born, rosy-fingered Dawn appeared, right at that time then they began bringing themselves back to the midst of the broad camp of the Achaeans.
2274373 For them  the far-shooter Apollo set in motion a favorable wind.
2274374 And as for those men, they stood up for themselves the mast and spread high and wide the white sails.
2274374a Wind swelled the sail in its center.
2274374b And on both sides a wave, surging, was splashing against the front of the ship, as it travelled.
2274375 And that ship, making time through its path, kept running over the wave.
2274376 And then, after  they arrived at the broad camp of the Achaeans, first they pulled the black ship onto land, far up upon the sandy shore, and then they laid out the long supports underneath.
2274377 Then the men themselves began to scatter throughout both the resting-places and
2274378 Meanwhile that man remained filled with wrath, sitting alongside his swift-sailing ships- - the descendent of Zeus, son of Peleus, swift-footed Achilles:
2274379 Neither did he ever resume his habit of entering into the assembly that brings glory to men, nor into war.
2274379a Instead he kept wearing and wearing away his beloved heart, remaining right where he was.
2274379b He kept longing and longing for both the battle-shout and war.
2274380 However   from that point, when the twelfth dawn took place then   the gods, existing always, went to Olympus, all of them at the same time.
2274380a Zeus was leading the way.
2274381 Thetis  was not forgetful of the demands of her own son-
2274381a Far from it: that woman rose up over a wave of the sea.
2274382 In the early morning  she went up to great heaven and Olympus.
2274383 She found  the far-seeing son of Cronos sitting apart from the others, on the highest summit of many-peaked Olympus.
2274384 And so then she sat down before Zeus himself,
2274384a and she laid hold of his knees with her left hand,
2274384b and  with her right hand she gripped beneath his chin, pleading with him, she addressed the lord Zeus, son of Cronos:
2274385 “Father Zeus, if at any time  I among the immortals helped you, either by word or by deed, fulfill this wish for me:
2274386 treat my son with proper respect, he who was doomed to the most swift death of others.
2274387 Instead, now  the lord of men Agamemnon has shown disrespect to him.
2274388 For he, having snatched his prize, holds it- - he himself having stolen it.
2274389 Instead you for your part, I beg you, show proper respect for him, all-wise Olympian Zeus:
2274390 so long  place in the possession the Trojans superior strength, until the Achaeans show proper respect to my son and glorify him with a position of respect.
2274391 So she spoke,
2274392 and he did not address her at all, Zeus the cloud-summoner.
2274392a Rather, in silence he remained motionless for a long time.
2274393 And as Thetis took hold for herself his knees, in this way she kept holding herself on, having attached herself on him.
2274393a And again a second time she began to petition him:
2274394 “Promise most faithfully to me, and nod your head in approval, or refuse, since for you fear does not exist, so that I may know well how greatly I am the most disrespected goddess among all.
2274395 That woman , he answered, greatly agitated, , Zeus the cloud-summoner:
2274396 “Without a doubt  these deeds are destructive, since you will push me to stir up a fight with Hera, when she would torment me with insulting words.
2274397 And  to be sure in the same manner, among the immortal gods, with me always she picks fights.
2274397a And she even claims that I support the Trojans in battle.
2274398 But as for you, first, go back now, lest she should become aware of anything, Hera.
2274399 Then these things will be an an object of concern for me until I am completely finished with it.
2274400 But come- I will nod my approval to you with my head so that you may have settled confidence.
2274401 As you know, this from me is truly the greatest sign among the immortals.
2274402 for mine is not to be taken back, nor something that can deceive, nor can it go unfulfilled- - whatever I may nod my approval to with my head.
2274403 He spoke,
2274403a And with his dark brows, he gave the nod of approval, the son of Cronos.
2274404 And  his divine hair flowed down from the lord’s immortal head.
2274405 And he shook great Olympus.
2274406 Then the two, having planned together in this way, separated.
2274407 Then, she, for her part, lept from glittering Olympus into the deep sea, while Zeus went to his own home.
2274408 All the gods stood up at the same time from their seats in front of their father;
2274409 not one of them had the nerve to stay in their place as he was approaching.
2274409a Instead facing him in greeting, they stood- - each and every one of them.
2274410 So there indeed he sat down on his throne.
2274411 But Hera, when she had seen him, did not fail to understand that she had fashioned plans together with him, silver-footed Thetis, the daughter of the old man of the sea.
2274412 Right then and there with cutting words she began to address Zeus, the son of Cronos:
2274413 “Who  of the gods fashioned plans together with you, devious one, this time?
2274414 It is always dear to you being far away from me, thinking secret things to pass judgment on.
2274415 To me have you not yet with determination brought yourself to give expression to whatever you may have in mind.
2274416  Then he began to answer her, the father of both men and of gods:
2274417 “Hera, do not  expect to know all my decisions:
2274418 they will be too difficult for you, despite being my wife.
2274419 This is how it is. Of course, whatever  is fitting to hear, then not anyone, neither any of the gods nor of humans will know that decision before you.
2274420 But, that said, whatever decision I, for my part, might choose to think through separately from the gods, Do not in any way as for, you, for your part- do not in any way pose questions about or inquire after each and every one of these things.
2274421 Then  she began to answer him, the ox-eyed, revered Hera:
2274422 “You are the worst, son of Cronos, what sort of command was that which you said?
2274423  Up until now indeed I neither question you constantly, nor do I make inquiries.
2274423a But you, very much at-ease, plan these things however you should choose.
2274424 And now I am filled with fear horribly down through my heart, that she may have convinced you, silver-footed Thetis, daughter of the old man of the sea.
2274425 For in the early morning she seated herself beside you
2274425a and took hold of your knees.
2274426 To her, I think that you actually nodded in approval so that you would show respect to Achilles, and you would destroy many of the Achaeans beside the ships.
2274427 Answering,  cloud-summoner Zeus addressed her:
2274428 “You are out of your mind! You always  are calculating.
2274428a And never do I slip past you.
2274429 All the same,  you will not be able to accomplish anything.
2274429a Instead from my heart you will be much more distant.
2274430 And this will be even more to be feared by you.
2274431 If  this is like this, it is going to be pleasing to me.
2274432 Instead, sit in silence!
2274432a Obey my command, or else however many gods that are in Olympus now would not protect you from me, coming close, when I would set invincible hands in motion against you.
2274433 So he spoke.
2274433a And she became frightened, the ox-eyed, revered Hera.
2274433b So in silence she sat down, clamping down on her beloved heart.
2274434 Throughout the house of Zeus the heavenly gods were made upset.
2274435 Among them  Hephaestus, celebrated for his ability to make things, began to speak to the group conveying pleasing things to his beloved mother, white-armed Hera:
2274436 “Without a doubt  these deeds will be destructive, and they will not be tolerable any longer if  you two quarrel in this way because of mortals and stir up a brawl among the gods.
2274437 Nor will there be any enjoyment of this good feast, since the worse win.
2274438 To my mother I for my part give this advice , even though she can think for herself: to convey pleasing things to my beloved father Zeus, so that my father would not fight again and disturb the feast along with us.
2274439 For there is indeed the possibility that the Olympian of lightning would choose to shove us out of our seats.
2274440 That one, as we all know, is the one who can generate the most force by far.
2274441 Instead, you on your end, addressing that man with soft words.
2274442 Immediately then the Olympian will be gracious to us.
2274443 He spoke  thus.
2274443a And, having lept up, he placed a two-handled cup in his dear mother’s hand.
2274443b And he spoke to her:
2274444 “Be strong, my mother.
2274444a And hold yourself up, although being troubled, lest I may see in my eyes you, beloved as you are, being beaten.
2274444b And then I will not be able, though stricken with pain, to offer protection in any way.
2274445 As you know, the Olympian is very hard to set oneself against.
2274446 For before now, also at another time as I was attempting to defend you, he flung me, having seized my foot, down from the divine threshold.
2274446a Throughout the entire day I was propelled.
2274446b Along with  the setting sun I ended my downward fall on Lemnos.
2274446c But still a little spirit was still present within.
2274447 There the Sintian men straight away took care of me, after having fallen.
2274448 So he spoke.
2274448a And white-armed goddess Hera smiled.
2274448b And, after having smiled, she accepted from her child the cup in her hand.
2274449 As for him, that one, starting from the left and moving to the right, for all the other gods began to pour out wine, drawing sweet nectar out of the mixing-bowl;
2274450 Laughter too loud to be drowned out  then was stirred up among the blessed gods, as they saw Hephaestus bustling through the house.
2274451 Then in this manner all day, until the sun had set, they kept sharing the feast.
2274451a Neither was their heart lacking anything of the equally-divided feast, nor indeed of the outstandingly beautiful lyre, which Apollo was holding, nor of the Muses, who were singing, taking turns, with a beautiful voice.
2274452 And then, after the shining light of the sun sank down, the rest of them  each went to their home in order to lie down, where for each the widely-renowned and crippled in both feet Hephaestus made a house, with his knowing mind.
2274453 And Olympian Zeus, god of lightning, made his way to his bed.
2274453a There formerly he used to rest himself when sweet sleep might come to him.
2274454 There, having ascended, he lay down to sleep.
2274454a And at his side was golden-throned Hera.
