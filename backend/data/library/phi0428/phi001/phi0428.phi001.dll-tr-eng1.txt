1. With the kindling of the Alexandrian War Caesar summoned his whole fleet from Rhodes and from Syria and Cilicia. He called up archers from Crete, cavalry from Malchus, king of the Nabataeans. He ordered siege engines to be collected from everywhere, grain to be sent, and reinforcements to be brought. In the meantime his fortifications were being strengthened every day with defensive works, and every part of the town that seemed to be less secure was being furnished with overhead shelters and covered galleries. Battering rams were carried from buildings into neighboring buildings through holes, and the fortifications were extended into all of the territory that was either cast down in ruins or taken by force. For Alexandria is mostly safe from fire, since the buildings lack wooden flooring and are held together by masonry and vaulted structures and covered with rubble and tiles. Caesar was particularly eager to close off part of the town—the part that a marsh coming in from the south made very narrow—from the rest of the city by employing defensive works and screens. His first expectation was that although the city had been divided into two parts his army would be managed according to one plan and authority, and then that it would be possible for support to be provided for his troops when they were struggling and for aid to be brought from the other part of the town, but especially that he would have an abundance of water and fodder. (He had a scanty supply of one of the two (sc. water), and no access at all to the other (sc. fodder).) As to which the marsh could bountifully supply each.
