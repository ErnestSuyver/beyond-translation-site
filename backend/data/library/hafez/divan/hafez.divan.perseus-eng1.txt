Hence , where *** Look not at the apple dimple of the chin for in the path is a great pit ### O heart where goest thou With this haste , where *** O friend from Hafiz seek neither ease nor patience ### Ease , what Patience , what Sleep , where ***

1.10 Last night the first day of Eternity without beginning from the masjid the place where the soul is separate from the body towards the wine tavern the stage of truth and love our Pir Muhammad came ### O friends of the Path after this lapse of time , and this departure what is our plan *** How may we , disciples , turn to the Ka'ba the Masjid when ### Our Pir Muhammad hath his face towards the house of the Vintner the stage of Truth and Love *** In the Fire - worshipper's Tavern the stage of Truth and Love we also shall be lodging ### For , in the Covenant of eternity without beginning , even so was our destiny . *** In the bond of His the Beloved's tress , how happy is the Heart If Wisdom know , ### In pursuit of our tress - chain , the wise will become distraught . *** The prey of tranquillity had fallen into the snare of the bird of the heart ### Thou loosedest thy tress and again went from the hand our prey . *** By its grace , Thy beautiful face explained to us a verse of the Kuran ### For that reason , in our explanation , is naught save grace and beauty . *** A single night , against Thy stony heart , ever effecteth aught ### Our sigh , fire - raining supplicating God and the burning of our heart in the night - time *** Upon Thy black tress , came the dishevelling wind the world from seeing that dishevelling became black to me ### Than the passion for Thy tress , more than this is not our honouring that we fall into tumult *** Beyond the sphere passeth the arrow of our sigh . Hafiz silence . ### Show compassion to thy soul avoid the arrow of ours . *** At the door of the wine - house , dweller I shall be like Hafiz , ### Since a tavern - haunter became that friend of the Path , the Pir of ours . ***
1.11 Saki murshid with the light of wine divine love up - kindle the cup of the heart of ours . ### Minstrel murshid speak , saying The world's work hath gone agreeably to the desire of' ours . *** In the cup of the heart we have beheld the reflection of the face of the Beloved God ### O thou void of knowledge of the joy of the perpetual wine - drinking of ours . *** The coy glance and the grace of those straight of stature illusory beloved ones is only till ### With grace , moving like a lofty pine - tree , cometh the cypress the true Beloved of ours . *** Never dieth that one , whose heart is alive with true love to God ### On the world's record , is written the everlasting existence of ours . *** On the day of up - rising the resurrection I fear , a profit taketh not . ### The lawful bread piety of the shaikh , more than the unlawful water wine of love of ours . *** O breeze if thou pass by the rose - bed of beloved ones , ### Take care present to the beloved the murshid the message of ours . *** O breeze from thy memory , our name why purposely takest thou ### Itself forgetfulness cometh , when after death cometh no recollection of ours . *** To the eye of our heart - binding beloved the murshid pleasing is intoxication ### For that reason , to intoxication they Fate and Destiny have given the rein of ours . *** The green blue sea of sky , and the bark of the new moon the mysteries of the sphere ### Are immersed'in the favour of Haji Kivam the murshid of ours . *** Like the tulip , in the cold air of love my heart was caught contracted ### O bird of fortune Beloved of the soul when wilt thou go into the snare drawings of love of ours *** Hafiz from thy eye , keep shedding a tear - drop ### It may be , that the bird of union may attempt the snare of ours . ***
